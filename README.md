Video classification using TSM + ResNet and ResNeXT \n
With the development of the field of computer vision, the need to determine human movements using neural networks rises. However, with the increase in video volumes on Internet platforms, the difficulty of obtaining a model with high accuracy and low computational cost increases. Therefore, researchers develop past designs to meet new requirements. In this article, we want to show the solution for the problem of sampling the videos into frames and train model on each 2nd frame to reduce computational cost. However, such approach leads to poor accuracy. Thus, in this article, we present a efficient model for video recognition with a combination of time-shift module and popular neural networks as a backbone which can solve action recognition problem using full video and minimum computational cost.
